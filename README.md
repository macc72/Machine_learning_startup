Scikit learn basics
Start - June 2025

I started off with a simple LinearRegression model and tried to predict the squares of numbers
I learned the first part from a YT short video. The squares prediction was my own creativity.
After asking chatGPT to explain the lines I was on track locked and loaded to explore more.
I added plots to visualize the predictions and the previous data using line graphs.

Libraries used throughout this startup;
- Numpy
- Scikit learn (sklearn)
- Matplotlib
